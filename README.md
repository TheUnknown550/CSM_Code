# Cardiac Self-Monitoring Tool (CS-M Tool) â€“ Code Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the **experimental and testing code** for the CS-M Tool project, which aims to tackle **heart disease detection** through a combination of a custom recording device, a React Native app, and Neural Network AI. The focus here is on **AF detection, noise filtering, and algorithm testing**.

## Repository Structure

- **AF Algorithm/**  
  Contains scripts to implement and automatically test the AF detection algorithm.  

- **NoiseCancel/**  
  Scripts for noise cancellation and preprocessing heart sound data.  

- **Random_Python/**  
  Miscellaneous testing scripts related to AF detection experiments.  

- **Sounds/**  
  Sample heart sound files used for testing and training the AI.  

- **Test.py / Test copy.py**  
  Scripts to test AF detection workflows and validate results.  

- **.gitattributes**  
  Git configuration file.
